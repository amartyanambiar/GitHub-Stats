## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The project uses access token that has read access to private repositories and if there is any
exception while reading data from any repository it throws Exception which is printed in the workflow logs. 
This exception will be viewable in the Actions tab of the repository fork, and
anyone may be able to see the name of one or more private repositories.

## ⚙️ Installation


1. Create a personal access token (not the default GitHub Actions token) using
   the instructions
   [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
   Personal access token must have permissions: `read:user` and `repo`. Copy
   the access token when it is generated – if you lose it, you will have to
   regenerate the token.

2. Click [here](https://github.com/YuanYap/GitHub-Stats/fork) to create a
   fork of this repository

3. If this is the README of your fork, click [this
   link](../../settings/secrets/actions) to go to the "Secrets" page.
   Otherwise, go to the "Settings" tab of the newly-created repository and go
   to the "Secrets" page (bottom left).
   
   
4. Create a new secret with the name `ACCESS_TOKEN` and paste the copied
   personal access token as the value.



5. By default the languages, stars, forks and repository views do not consider stats from 
   public repositories that you have forked and contributed to. But if you want to count stats from
   forked repositories also you can do so by creating a new secret called `COUNT_STATS_FROM_FORKS`. 
   For the value you can put any random value because the action only checks if the secret is set or not.


6. Go to the [Actions Page](../../actions?query=workflow%3A"Generate+Stats+Images") and press "Run
   Workflow" on the right side of the screen to generate images for the first
   time. The images will be periodically generated every hour, but they can be
   manually regenerated by manually running the workflow.

7. Check out the images that have been created in the [`generated`](../output/generated)
   folder in `output` branch.

8. Link back to this repository so that others can generate their own
   statistics images.

8. Star this repo if you like it!
